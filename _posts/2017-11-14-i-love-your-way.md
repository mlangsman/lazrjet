This marks the first release on my new label Cabriolet Records. If Thelma and Louise ran a record label this would be it - music to listen to with the roof down and a platform for creative freedom.

‘I Love You Way’ is feel good, upbeat and romantic number so I put together a video of fitting moments from cult films from my formative years such as Top Gun, Ferris Buellers Day Off and a touch of Kylie for good measure!
