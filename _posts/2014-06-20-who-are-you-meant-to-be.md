I love this drawing from one of my favourite cartoonists <a title="@GapingVoid" href="http://www.gapingvoidart.com/" target="_blank">@GapingVoid</a>. It sums up exactly why I left the banking industry many years ago and ended up making tea in a recording studio. As <a title="Hegarty on Creativity" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hegarty-Creativity-There-are-Rules/dp/050051724X" target="_blank">John Hegarty</a> says:
