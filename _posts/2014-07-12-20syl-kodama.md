I hand't heard of 20SYL until I came across this totally awesome video which I think goes to show what a great bit of viral media can do.

The video was all shot in a garage and because I'm a bit of a music-tech trainspotter, the kit list is as follows :
<ul>
	<li>Akai MPC-2000</li>
	<li>Teenage Engineering OP-1</li>
	<li>Moog Pedal</li>
	<li>Novation Launchpad</li>
	<li>Sequential Circuits Six-Trak</li>
	<li>MicroKorg</li>
	<li>Soundwagon</li>
</ul>
I don't know if all this kit was actually used in the production of the track or if it's just for effect.
