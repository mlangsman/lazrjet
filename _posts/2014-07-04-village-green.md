At the end of last year my wife and I made the decision to quit the big smoke and move out of London to leafy Hertfordshire. As my current job is based in town, I was pretty freaked out about becoming a commuter and living out in the sticks.

As is frequently the case, it turns out our worst fears are often nothing more than just that.

The commute is not one I plan on doing forever, but it turns out that getting off the train at the end of a long day and stepping into the English countryside is literally like a breath of fresh air. Taking in the trees, birds and beautiful scenery on the walk between home and the station has become a daily dose of inspiration.
