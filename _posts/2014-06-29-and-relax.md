Ideas can come from anywhere but sometimes the best ones appear when you are completely relaxed and have a quiet mind.

Well what better place for this than a nice hot bath? It certainly did the trick for Archimedes.

My latest track is inspired by an amazing custom bath soak I recently received from <a title="The Bathory" href="http://thebathory.com" target="_blank">The Bathory</a>, a brand new venture by the guys at <a title="Mint" href="http://mintdigital.com/" target="_blank">Mint</a>.

It's a different direction from my more recent up-tempo numbers, but I find that when British Summertime kicks in I'm inclined to drop things down a notch as the cold chills slowly melt away.
