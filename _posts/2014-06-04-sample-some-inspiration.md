I've always been inspired by the use of sampling in music especially folk like The Avalanches and DJ Shadow. It's not always obvious that plenty of dance music is heavily built around samples, but a quick shufty on <a title="WhoSampled" href="http://whosampled.com" target="_blank">WhoSampled</a> is amazingly enlightening.

I love the notion of digging around dusty crates however, because I spend a lot of time producing on trains and in hotel lobbies I've started to use Spotify instead. It's like having a whole word of record shops at your fingertips! I have a playlist setup especially for sampling, and I keep it available offline so I can dig through and record samples wherever I'm working.

I started a new track today and flicked through my library of samples for some inspiration. Im loving lots of 80's influences at the moment and a vocal loop from Force M.D.'s <a title="Tender Love" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPUAquX4tR0" target="_blank">Tender Love</a> proved perfect to get the party started....
